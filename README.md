 # A Mechanistic Study of Plant and Microbial Controls over R* for Nitrogen in an Annual Grassland
 ## R*
- R* theory holds that better competitors within a N limited community should better depress available N in monoculture plots and obtain higher abundance in mixture plots.
- Plant species differ in their ability to deplete a limiting resource, and the species that maintains a positive growth rate at the lowest level of this resource will emerge as the competitive dominant.
- R* is the equilibrium concentration of resources necessary for the consumer (plant) species to maintain a stable population.
- A negative relationship between species’ R* and their relative biomass in mixture supports R* theory, since the species depleting resources to the lowest levels are the competitive dominants.
 ## Question
### What drives species-specific R* values in the first place?
1.Plant uptake? 
2.Microbial nutrient cycling and sequestration?
- Three models

## Materials and Methods
### Site and Experimental Design
- Five ‘blocks’
- 14 plots (one bare, one mixture and 12 monoculture plots)
- 15 grams of seed/m2 to each plot
- Fence , water, remove nontarget species
### Measure
 1) pool sizes of total N in plants;
 2) DIN at the end of the growing season (our measure of R*) and over time;
 3) microbial pools and process rates (microbial N, microbial biomass, net N mineralization, gross NO3- production, and NO3- production, and nitrification potential).
## Results

- In contrast to microbes, plants were a much larger N pool, about ten-fold higher than microbial biomass N.

- Vegetated plots had lower DIN (R*) values than bare plots

Plots with high plant biomass maintained lower DIN.

Monoculture plant biomass N was significantly and negatively correlated with soil DIN.

Microbial biomass N and SIR biomass had no relationship with DIN.

There was no relationship between DIN and our indicator of microbial N cycling rates, net N mineralization.

Our two metrics of the conversion of NH4+ to NO3-, nitrification potential and gross nitrate production, did show significant positive correlations with DIN.

This suggests that microbes released more plant available N over the course of the growing season in those plots with higher plant biomass and lower R*, even though our measure of microbial N turnover, net N mineralization, did not differ between plots.

Microbial N cycling in the field may have been negatively, rather than uncorrelated or positively correlated with DIN.

## Conclusion
- Main driving force: plant uptake
- Microbes were not driving differences in soil DIN via direct uptake and immobilization of available N into microbial biomass.
- Plant N uptake would be negatively correlated to DIN, and microbial N cycling would be lightly positively correlated to DIN, too.
